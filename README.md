# SchoolPortal
A simple program that arranges helpful websites for schools in a user-friendly fashion. Additional features include an intuitive to-do list, a simple news feed, and more!

### What is SchoolPortal?
This is a program I wrote for my school a while back. Since then, I have abandoned the project. It is finished, but was never used by the corporation. 

### Who can use it?
Feel free to use the School Portal however you would like. I don't care what you do with it, as long as you credit me. (John Spahr)

### Message for schools
While this program is complete, it will need to be modified for your corporation. It still has the links and other stuff for my school. You will need to edit that. Also, it is vital that you know how to code in C#, as you will need to edit the code to get it ready for your administration. You should probably download Microsoft Visual Studio as well.
